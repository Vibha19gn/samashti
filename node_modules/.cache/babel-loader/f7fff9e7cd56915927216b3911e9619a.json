Also the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers made us think about slowly transitioning farmers to sustainable growing methods. As we are all aware, agriculture and farming constitute 20% percent of our GDP.  Our nation\\u2019s development lies in the villages and if people in the villages are happy then the development that happens around it will be sustainable and we can mitigate the problem of mass migration to cities or urban areas. Lack of Organic Farming knowledge, basic know how, assistance and initial help are all missing for many farmers and we at Samashti want to address this problem and would want to collectively work with several players in the market to facilitate bringing the required help for the farmers. Samashti was started during COVID seeing the struggles of the farmers trying to live through this tough time with regard to finance, loans, supply chain, better pricing. Samashti\\u2019s aim is to work collectively with all the relevant sections of society that will make farmers\\u2019 life easy, sustainable and will make them proud of their profession. Farming is a very low paying job for many marginal farmers. It is also very difficult profession because of various factors like weather, soil, irrigation, labour, market access and better price for their produce.  This is causing a lot of the younger generation to migrate to urban areas looking for better life. Also, following organic practice is very difficult because of pest and other problems, so they opt for inorganic way of farming by which they erode the soil fertility causing harm in the longer run. Samashti wants to change that perspective and wants to make farmer feel proud of their profession and also want them to happily convert to organic farming with ease. Samashti\\u2019s vision is to transform every village into a self-sustainable village in the near future. As the name suggests, Samashti means collective existence.  To start with, we have adopted a small village () a and the farmers in that village and we plan do the transition farmers in that village toward sustainable organic farming. We have started our work by collaborating with BERU (Back to Roots), a community organization which has been working with several farmers from that village for the past 2 years. BERU is run by three young vibrant farmer entrepreneurs who left their plush IT jobs and settled in that village. They have been helping farmers to convert to organic farmers by teaching them the knowhow, and creating market access for their product at better price. Due to shortage of funds and other logistics, it is taking longer than expected and now Samashti is helping them by raising funds.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 131,\n            columnNumber: 11\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(FullpageSection, {\n            style: {\n              backgroundColor: '#F1B24A',\n              color: '#05293B'\n            },\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n              children: \"Bank Gov agency CSR partners Contact US SAMASHTI FOUNDATION Registered Office: 22, Embassy Tranqui, Apt#403, 8th Main 3rd Block, Koramangala, Bangalore Email: samashtifoundation@yahoo.com, Samashti.india@gmail.com Phone: 9663973295, 9663879295 Facebook: @Samashtifoundation Media Gallery and Youtube videos Volunteers\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 155,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 151,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 29,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 16,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 14,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this);\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default Main;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/kamleshnehra/Desktop/samashti/src/components/Main.js"],"names":["React","Component","Fullpage","FullPageSections","FullpageSection","FullpageNavigation","FullpageContext","Menu","config","Main","constructor","props","render","menu","backgroundColor","color"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,OAAOC,QAAP,IAAmBC,gBAAnB,EAAqCC,eAArC,EAAsDC,kBAAtD,EAA0EC,eAA1E,QAAgG,uBAAhG;AACA,OAAOC,IAAP,MAAiB,QAAjB;AACA,OAAO,KAAKC,MAAZ,MAAwB,WAAxB;;AAEA,MAAMC,IAAN,SAAmBR,SAAnB,CAA6B;AAE3BS,EAAAA,WAAW,CAACC,KAAD,EAAQ;AACjB,UAAMA,KAAN;AACD;;AAEDC,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,wBACE,QAAC,KAAD,CAAO,UAAP;AAAA,6BAEE,QAAC,QAAD;AAAA,gCAEE;AAAK,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;AAAA,kCACE;AAAK,YAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADF,eAIE;AAAK,YAAA,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;AAAA,mCACE,QAAC,IAAD;AAAM,cAAA,SAAS,EAAIJ,MAAM,CAACK;AAA1B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAJF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAFF,eAWE,QAAC,kBAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAXF,eAaE,QAAC,gBAAD;AAAA,kCAEE,QAAC,eAAD;AAAiB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACtBC,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SADK;AAEtBC,cAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFe,aAAxB;AAAA,mCAIE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAJF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAFF,eA4BE,QAAC,eAAD;AAAiB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACtBD,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SADK;AAEtBC,cAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFe,aAAxB;AAAA,mCAIE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAJF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBA5BF,eAkEE,QAAC,eAAD;AAAiB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACtBD,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SADK;AAEtBC,cAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFe,aAAxB;AAAA,mCAIE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAJF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAlEF,eA2FE,QAAC,eAAD;AAAiB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACtBD,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SADK;AAEtBC,cAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFe,aAAxB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBA3FF,eAsGA,QAAC,eAAD;AAAiB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACtBD,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SADK;AAEtBC,cAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFe,aAAxB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAtGA,eA0HE,QAAC,eAAD;AAAiB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACtBD,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SADK;AAEtBC,cAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFe,aAAxB;AAAA,mCAIE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAJF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBA1HF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAbF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADF;AAyKD;;AAhL0B;;AAmL7B,eAAeN,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Fullpage, { FullPageSections, FullpageSection, FullpageNavigation, FullpageContext} from '@ap.cx/react-fullpage';\nimport Menu from \"./Menu\";\nimport * as config from \"../config\";\n\nclass Main extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <React.StrictMode>\n\n        <Fullpage>\n\n          <div className=\"header\">\n            <div className=\"logo\">\n              SAMASHTI\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"navigation\">\n              <Menu menuItems = {config.menu}/>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <FullpageNavigation/>\n\n          <FullPageSections>\n\n            <FullpageSection style={{\n              backgroundColor: '#164A41',\n              color: '#05293B',\n            }}>\n              <div>\n\n                Samashti foundation is a not-for-profit social cause organization started for two main reasons.

Also, following organic practice is very difficult because of pest and other problems, so they opt for inorganic way of farming by which they erode the soil fertility causing harm in the longer run.\n\n            Samashti wants to change that perspective and wants to make farmer feel proud of their profession and also want them to happily convert to organic farming with ease.\n            Samashti’s vision is to transform every village into a self-sustainable village in the near future.\n            As the name suggests, Samashti means collective existence.  To start with, we have adopted a small village () a and the farmers in that village and we plan do the transition farmers in that village toward sustainable organic farming.\n\n            We have started our work by collaborating with BERU (Back to Roots), a community organization which has been working with several farmers from that village for the past 2 years.\n            BERU is run by three young vibrant farmer entrepreneurs who left their plush IT jobs and settled in that village. They have been helping farmers to convert to organic farmers by teaching them the knowhow, and creating market access for their product at better price. Due to shortage of funds and other logistics, it is taking longer than expected and now Samashti is helping them by raising funds.\n\n          </FullpageSection>\n\n            <FullpageSection style={{\n              backgroundColor: '#F1B24A',\n              color: '#05293B',\n            }}>\n              <div>\n                Bank\n                Gov agency\n                CSR partners\n\n\n                Contact US\n                SAMASHTI FOUNDATION\n                Registered Office: 22, Embassy Tranqui, Apt#403, 8th Main 3rd Block, Koramangala, Bangalore\n                Email: samashtifoundation@yahoo.com, Samashti.india@gmail.com\n                Phone: 9663973295, 9663879295\n                Facebook: @Samashtifoundation\n\n                Media\n\n                Gallery and Youtube videos\n\n                Volunteers\n\n              </div>\n            </FullpageSection>\n\n          </FullPageSections>\n\n        </Fullpage>\n      </React.StrictMode>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Main;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
