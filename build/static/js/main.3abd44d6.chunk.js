Also the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers made us think about slowly transitioning farmers to sustainable growing methods. As we are all aware, agriculture and farming constitute 20% percent of our GDP.  Our nation\u2019s development lies in the villages and if people in the villages are happy then the development that happens around it will be sustainable and we can mitigate the problem of mass migration to cities or urban areas. Lack of Organic Farming knowledge, basic know how, assistance and initial help are all missing for many farmers and we at Samashti want to address this problem and would want to collectively work with several players in the market to facilitate bringing the required help for the farmers. Samashti was started during COVID seeing the struggles of the farmers trying to live through this tough time with regard to finance, loans, supply chain, better pricing. Samashti\u2019s aim is to work collectively with all the relevant sections of society that will make farmers\u2019 life easy, sustainable and will make them proud of their profession. Farming is a very low paying job for many marginal farmers. It is also very difficult profession because of various factors like weather, soil, irrigation, labour, market access and better price for their produce.  This is causing a lot of the younger generation to migrate to urban areas looking for better life. Also, following organic practice is very difficult because of pest and other problems, so they opt for inorganic way of farming by which they erode the soil fertility causing harm in the longer run. Samashti wants to change that perspective and wants to make farmer feel proud of their profession and also want them to happily convert to organic farming with ease. Samashti\u2019s vision is to transform every village into a self-sustainable village in the near future. As the name suggests, Samashti means collective existence.  To start with, we have adopted a small village () a and the farmers in that village and we plan do the transition farmers in that village toward sustainable organic farming. We have started our work by collaborating with BERU (Back to Roots), a community organization which has been working with several farmers from that village for the past 2 years. BERU is run by three young vibrant farmer entrepreneurs who left their plush IT jobs and settled in that village. They have been helping farmers to convert to organic farmers by teaching them the knowhow, and creating market access for their product at better price. Due to shortage of funds and other logistics, it is taking longer than expected and now Samashti is helping them by raising funds."})]})},j=function(e){return Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"container contact-us",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{className:"section-heading",children:"Contact Us"}),Object(i.jsx)("div",{className:"container-section",children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"address",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h4",{children:"SAMASHTI FOUNDATION"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"Registered Office: 22, Embassy Tranqui, Alit#403, 8th Main 3rd Block, Koramangala, Bangalore"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"Email: samashtifoundation@yahoo.com, Samashti.india@gmail.com"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"Teliphone: 9663973295, 9663879295"}),Object(i.jsxs)("div",{children:["Follow us on ",Object(i.jsx)("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://www.facebook.com/samashtiindia",children:"Facebook"})," ",Object(i.jsx)("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://www.instagram.com/samashtifoundation/",children:"Instagram"})]})]})})]})},v=(a(23),a(27),["Adopting a village and their farmers","Assessing the requirements","Raising fund through individual contributions, CSR funding, community collaboration, Bank tieups for loans, fund raising through p2p platforms and other business collaborations","Utilizing the funds at the village level over a period of time","Simultaneously enable technology to improve ease of farming","Implement various means to measure improvement and productivity of Organic Farming","Creating sustainable model for the longer run","Move out of the village to next village for the same transition"]),O=["Home","How it works","Our Mission","About us"," Contact us"],w=[{component:b,styles:{height:"100vh",backgroundColor:"rgb(65 130 63)",color:"#FFFFFF",overflowY:"auto",paddingTop:"100px"}},{component:function(e){return Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"container how-it-work",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{className:"section-heading",children:"How it Works"}),Object(i.jsx)("div",{className:"container-section ",children:v.map((function(e){return Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:e})}))})]})},styles:{height:"100vh",backgroundColor:"#0E5518",color:"#FFFFFF",overflowY:"auto",paddingTop:"100px"}},{component:function(e){return Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"container our-project",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{className:"section-heading",children:"Our Mission"}),Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-section",children:[Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"What is the Mission of Samashti?"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"To Facilitate funding for easy transition to Organic Farming"}),Object(i.jsxs)("ul",{children:[Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:" To facilitate fund raising required to make the village self-sufficient with all the infrastructure required to conduct organic farming."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:" We plan to enable an ecosystem of farm inputs for smooth transition of farmers through collaboration with various suppliers and service providers."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:" To raise funds for training the farmers for easy transition."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:" To make the farmers feel proud of their profession and enable them to become contributors for creating future organic farmers for our beautiful India."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:" To enable them to upgrade their earnings and livelihood to live comfortably and to create more employment opportunities for other residents of the village."}),Object(i.jsx)("li",{children:" Empower women in the household to become entrepreneurs in rearing livestock and other allied agricultural activities to support their livelihood.
